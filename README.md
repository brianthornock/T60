# T60
A PT2399-Based Reverb Pedal

Almost all DIY reverb pedals are based on one of two solutions: the Belton "brick" or the Spin FV-1 digital chip. They can produce great sounding delays, but run around $20 just for the one component. The T60 uses 4 PT2399 chips (the brick uses 3) to produce a great reverb sound, including size, mix, and dwell controls.
